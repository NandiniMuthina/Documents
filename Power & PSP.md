# IBM POWER SYSTEMS 
  - IBM is involved in Super Computers, Hardware, Chips, Processors, Lpatops, Game Stations..what not, it involved in almost everything including "rovers" (Perseverance rover)..., may be mobile phones is the only exception.
  - IBM systems mostly centered around Government projects and high-end servers.
  - IBM systems helps model SuperNova's, explore cancer, genetics and the environment even helps fight against COVID-19.
  
## POWER - Performance Optimization with Enhanced RISC.
## POWER SYSTEMS 
   - It is a family of server computers from IBM that are based on its Power processors. 
   - It was created in 2008 as a merger of the System p and System i product lines. 
   - Power helps customers respond faster to business demands, protect data from core to cloud, and streamline insights and automation while maximizing reliability in a sustainable way.     
   - Power can modernize applications and infrastructure with a frictionless hybrid cloud experience to provide the agility companies need.

## IBM Power Systems Software
   - Power Systems software provides organizations with the tools they need to build and manage cloud environments, accelerate the path to AI, help ensure high availability, achieve tight security, maintain compliance and streamline a full range of other infrastructure administration tasks.
     - Efficiently support a diverse array of applications running on Linux, IBM i and AIX operating systems.
     - Simplify private and hybrid cloud management.
     - Accelerate deployment of AI applications.
     - Meet critical business needs with high availability.
     - Manage security and compliance centrally.
   
## PSP - Power Systems Performance 
   - Our responsibility is to make sure that the systems, which IBM built are upto mark, the designs are appropriate enough to deliver the performance what we need/expect..
   - We will work on identifying bottlenecks and touches each and every aspect of system stack, to improvise throughput and reduce latency.
   - will involve in the entire system stack, and tries to see if there are any performance bottlenecks and addresses performance issues.

## Newer Generation Enterprise Workloads
   - Cloud Native Architecture.
   - Infusion of computer centric AI Algorithms into the enterprise workflow.
   - Highly data centric with huge compute demand.

### Why to understand workload ?
  - When a system is designed, it is always needfull to understand what is going to be executed in the system. So that, we can fully utilize the resources for that particular purpose.
  - PSP bridges the gap in understanding what the workload does and map it back to how the system can be designed...
